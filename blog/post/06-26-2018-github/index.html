I had this idea that I&#x27;d want to store some code somewhere I didn&#x27;t have to worry about losing it. <a href="https://mikemcquaid.com/2014/01/18/why-use-version-control/">You really should version control your code someway, somehow!</a></p>
<p>Now, I could have setup some server somewhere, but then I&#x27;d have to learn how to <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+create+a+git+server"><em>create a server</em></a>. Not that that&#x27;s a hard thing to do, but there&#x27;s other people who&#x27;ve figured out how to do this thing <em>wayyy</em> better than I could. <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> am I right?</p>
<p>Now, for my purposes, I also wanted to find a place to host a site. In this case, I was interested in finding a place to host a static website. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/"><strong>HTML</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2017/"><strong>CSS</strong></a>. Maybe some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources"><strong>JavaScript</strong></a>. To do a blog. About technology.</p>
<p>I know its 2018, this hosting thing isn&#x27;t all that new, but I wanted something simple. Turns out, Github has a thing called <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Which also has some hooks for deploying automatically to it on a branch (<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=git+branches">what&#x27;s a branch?</a>) called <em>gh-pages</em>. Using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>. That is definitely on for <a href="https://bryanrengo.com/blog/post/travis-ci">another post and another day</a>.</p>
<p>So, back on topic. How do we start our very own code repository? As usual, there&#x27;s quite a few options. We&#x27;re going start with creating a repository on Github.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an account on <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">Github</a> if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
<li>You have <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> installed, right?</li>
<li>Next, <a href="https://github.com/new">create a new repository</a>. </li>
<li>Open up your terminal. I know typing... But this is when it gets interesting.</li>
<li>There&#x27;s going to be a button on your created Github repo in green labelled <strong>Clone or download</strong>. Click on that button and copy the link provided. The link provided will look like this <a href="https://github.com/%5Byourusername%5D/%5Byourreponame%5D.git">https://github.com/[yourusername]/[yourreponame].git</a></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>        git clone [https://github.com/[yourusername]/[yourreponame].git
        cd [yourreponame]
</code></pre>
<p>Excellent! You&#x27;ve now gotten (gitten?) your first repo!</p>
<p>You can now at this point start buiding your own <em>thing</em>! If you&#x27;re just looking to get up and running with something quick, use this:</p>
<p>Create a file in the directory you cloned above called <em>index.html</em> with the following content <em>for example</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;xmp&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Hello Git Pages World&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Hello Git Pages World&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/xmp&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Save this file, and at this point, we&#x27;re almost there!</p>
<pre><code>    git add --all
    git commit -m &quot;Initial commit&quot;
    git push -u origin master
</code></pre>
<p>At this point we are all setup! You should be able to browse to your page defined in the Github Pages on the internet!</p></div></section></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript">window.__CSS_CHUNKS__ = {"main":"https://bryanrengo.com/styles.10827799.css"}</script><script type="text/javascript">
