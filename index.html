I had this idea that I'd want to store some code somewhere I didn't have to worry about losing it. <a href=\"https://mikemcquaid.com/2014/01/18/why-use-version-control/\">You really should version control your code someway, somehow!</a></p>\n<p>Now, I could have setup some server somewhere, but then I'd have to learn how to <a href=\"http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+create+a+git+server\"><em>create a server</em></a>. Not that that's a hard thing to do, but there's other people who've figured out how to do this thing <em>wayyy</em> better than I could. <a href=\"https://github.com\">Github</a> am I right?</p>\n<p>Now, for my purposes, I also wanted to find a place to host a site. In this case, I was interested in finding a place to host a static website. <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/\"><strong>HTML</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2017/\"><strong>CSS</strong></a>. Maybe some <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources\"><strong>JavaScript</strong></a>. To do a blog. About technology.</p>\n<p>I know its 2018, this hosting thing isn't all that new, but I wanted something simple. Turns out, Github has a thing called <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a>. Which also has some hooks for deploying automatically to it on a branch (<a href=\"http://lmgtfy.com/?q=git+branches\">what's a branch?</a>) called <em>gh-pages</em>. Using <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\">Travis CI</a>. That is definitely on for <a href=\"/blog/post/travis-ci\">another post and another day</a>.</p>\n<p>So, back on topic. How do we start our very own code repository? As usual, there's quite a few options. We're going start with creating a repository on Github.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create an account on <a href=\"https://github.com/join?source=header-home\">Github</a> if you haven't already.</li>\n<li>You have <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/downloads\">Git</a> installed, right?</li>\n<li>Next, <a href=\"https://github.com/new\">create a new repository</a>. </li>\n<li>Open up your terminal. I know typing... But this is when it gets interesting.</li>\n<li>There's going to be a button on your created Github repo in green labelled <strong>Clone or download</strong>. Click on that button and copy the link provided. The link provided will look like this <a href=\"https://github.com/%5Byourusername%5D/%5Byourreponame%5D.git\">https://github.com/[yourusername]/[yourreponame].git</a></li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>        git clone [https://github.com/[yourusername]/[yourreponame].git\n        cd [yourreponame]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Excellent! You've now gotten (gitten?) your first repo!</p>\n<p>You can now at this point start buiding your own <em>thing</em>! If you're just looking to get up and running with something quick, use this:</p>\n<p>Create a file in the directory you cloned above called <em>index.html</em> with the following content <em>for example</em></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;xmp>\n&#x3C;html>\n    &#x3C;head>\n        &#x3C;title>Hello Git Pages World&#x3C;/title>\n    &#x3C;/head>\n    &#x3C;body>\n        &#x3C;div>\n            &#x3C;h1>Hello Git Pages World&#x3C;/h1>\n        &#x3C;/div>\n    &#x3C;/body>\n&#x3C;/html>\n&#x3C;/xmp>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Save this file, and at this point, we're almost there!</p>\n<pre><code>    git add --all\n    git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n    git push -u origin master\n</code></pre>\n<p>At this point we are all setup! You should be able to browse to your page defined in the Github Pages on the internet!</p>\n","title":"Hosting a Static Site on Github","slug":"06-26-2018-github"},{"path":"/home/travis/build/rogue-bryan/rogue-blog/content/blog/travis-ci.md","name":"travis-ci.md","size":85,"extension":".md","type":"file","contents":"<p>Under Construction</p>\n","title":"Integrating Travis CI with Github","slug":"travis-ci"}]},"siteData":{"title":"Bryan's Tech Blog"}};</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="https://bryanrengo.com/bootstrap.261e639a.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="https://bryanrengo.com/templates/src/containers/Page.13aa58f8.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="https://bryanrengo.com/main.1dbaacda.js"></script></body></html>
