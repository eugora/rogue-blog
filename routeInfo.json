Sometimes it takes a great deal of thought to build out some useful content, and I&#39;m hoping that by blogging, I can help out people use this React-Static technology. Feel free to browse the blog content, I feel like this will help me focus on problems and solutions that I had building this site.</p>\n<p>This site will be updating as I develop content and ideas, but generally it will be used to explore the world of Node.js, React, React-Static and Markdown as the content rendering engine.</p>\n"}}}
